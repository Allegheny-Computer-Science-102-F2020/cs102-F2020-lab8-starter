In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a
remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more
surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect
English.

The group is called the Huilan unicorns, and researchers believe it is the
first sign of a surviving group of snow white animals in the region.

“It’s pretty exciting to be able to describe them as such,” said Jeff
Galimberti, the director of discovery projects at the field station in Peru
that first found the creatures. “The Huilan are truly a unique species. It’s a
unicorn within a unicorn.”

The discovery, published in the journal Current Biology, marked the third time
researchers have found an email that can speak perfect English.
